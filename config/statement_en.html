                SameGame is a puzzle composed of a rectangular grid containing cells of different
                colors. A move removes connected cells of the same color. The cells of other colors fall
                to fill the void created by a move down, and when a column is empty
                the columns on the right are moved to
                the left. At least two cells have to be removed for a move to
                be legal. The score of a move is the square of the number of removed cells minus two.
                A bonus of one thousand is credited for completely clearing the board.

                            <li>Game board has 15 rows and 15 columns, with <const>0 0</const> (<var>column</var> <var>row</var>) being the bottom left corner and <const>14 14</const> the upper right corner.</li>
                            <li>An action consist of choosing a tile on the bord, giving its coordinates (also using <var>column</var> <var>row</var> notation).</li>
                            <li>An action is legal if the pointed cell has at least one neighbour (in cardinal direction) of the same color.</li>
                            <li>There are five colors, encoded as integers: <const>0</const>, <const>1</const>, <const>2</const>, <const>3</const>, <const>4</const>, and the empty cells are encoded as <const>-1</const>.</li>
                            <li>A legal action removes the entire region of the same color connected with the chosen tile.</li>
                            <li>In every column, all blocks that were above removed cells fall down, so that there is no free space between them and the row 0.</li>
                            <li>Then, for every empty column, all columns that are on the right are moved maximally to the left, so that the row 0 has no gaps.</li>
                            <li>Choosing illegal action i.e. pointing out an empty cell or a region of size 1 ends the game with an error.</li>
                            <li>The game ends naturally when there are no legal actions, i.e. the tile <const>0 0</const> is empty or all remaining regions have size 1.</li>
                            <li>The score of the game is a cumulative score of each action.</li>
                            <li>The score of an action removing a region of size <const>n</const> is <const>(n-2)<sup>2</sup></const>.</li>
                            <li>When the board is cleared (tile <const>0 0</const> is empty), the score is additionally increased by <const>1000</const>.</li>
